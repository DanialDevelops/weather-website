# Fitness Tracker

## A Web Application for Tracking Fitness Activities

In this project, I developed a web application for users to track their fitness activities and monitor their progress over time.

### Things I worked on
- Implemented user authentication for secure login and registration.
- Designed a user-friendly interface for logging workouts, setting fitness goals, and viewing progress.
- Utilized Redux for efficient state management, providing a seamless user experience.
- Integrated Chart.js to visualize fitness data and provide insights into workout performance.

### Technologies Used
- MongoDB for database management.
- Express.js for building the server and handling routes.
- React.js for creating a dynamic and interactive front-end.
- Node.js for backend server development.
- Bootstrap for responsive and visually appealing UI components.
